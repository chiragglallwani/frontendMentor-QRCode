## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

At some point, I was confused with the font-size mention in style guide which was set to 15px, but I saw different font-size inside the card, therefore, I setup that as base size for body element.

```css
body{
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    font-size: 15px;
	font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```
